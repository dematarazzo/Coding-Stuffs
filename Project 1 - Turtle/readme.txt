#Describe what you did, how you did it, what challenges you encountered, and how you solved them.
I imported the turtle extension by writing import turtle in my code, as well as a maze png. I had a problem with the png because I tried
to include it in my project folder, but VSC wasn't recognizing it. I had to put the png into the parent folder rather than the project folder.
I didn't have many problems with the maze, but I was getting frustrated that the maze didn't stay open after the turtle had stopped moving.
I was able to trial and error the distance the turtle traveled to get it successfully to the end of the maze.

#Please answer any questions found throughout the narrative of this assignment.
I had no questions

#If collaboration with a buddy was permitted, did you work with a buddy on this assignment? If so, who? If not, do you certify that this #submission represents your own original work?
I did work alone, and everything I wrote came from myself

#Please identify any and all portions of your submission that were not originally written by you (for example, code originally written by #your buddy, or anything taken or adapted from a non-classroom resource). It is always OK to use your textbook and instructor notes; however, #you are certifying that any portions not designated as coming from an outside person or source are your own original work.
The intial part of the code setting up the tutle stuff came from the assigned website

#Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (I will not judge you for this at all...I am simply using it to gauge if #the assignments are too easy or hard)?
It took around 20 minutes from start to finish, including copying the text from the website, and fixing the problem I had with the png.

#Your overall impression of the assignment. Did you love it, hate it, or were you neutral? One word answers are fine, but if you have any #suggestions for the future let me know.
I think this assignment was fun and a good introduction to very simple coding.

#Using the grading specifications on this page, discuss briefly the grade you would give yourself and why. Discuss each item in the grading #specification.
I think this would be a 100. I followed the instructions well and I believe I am filling out the readme text file well.

#Any other concerns that you have. For instance, if you have a bug that you were unable to solve but you made progress, write that here. The #more you articulate the problem the more partial credit you will receive (it is fine to leave this blank).
